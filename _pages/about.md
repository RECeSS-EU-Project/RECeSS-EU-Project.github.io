In 2021, drug development pipelines last 10 years in average, and cost around $2 billion, while facing high failure rates, as only around 10% of Phase 0 drug candidates reach the commercialization stage [(source)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2022.02.002). These issues can be mitigated through *drug repurposing*, where existent compounds are systematically screened for new therapeutic indications. *Collaborative filtering* is a semi-supervised learning framework that leverages known drug-disease matchings to make novel recommendations. 

The RECeSS project is a two-year-long €190k research project funded by an European Union’s prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship 2022. In the short term, the RECeSS project would yield the first method that fully integrates biological interpretation and risk assessment to collaborative filtering-based repurposing. Long-term outcomes might help define sustainable and transparent drug development for rare diseases.

Research leads will be investigated by the postdoctoral fellow [Dr. Clémence Réda](https://clreda.github.io/). The project is primarily supervised by [Pr. Olaf Wolkenhauer](https://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/team/detail/prof-olaf-wolkenhauer), at SBI Rostock (Universität Rostock), in collaboration with [Dr. Jill-Jênn Vie](https://jjv.ie/), in the Soda team (Inria Saclay).
